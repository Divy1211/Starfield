# Starfield
1. I have coded a Starfied/Hyperspace simulator in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. It has very basic functionality only . If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisites
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works
1. You can control speed by relative mouse position
